                Water has spiritual meaning for almost all indigenous people. In some countries rivers have their own constitutional rights, their own persona. Granting of legal personality to waters is an important development that underlines the
                vision of indigenous people that water has a spiritual meaning. In the worldview of indigenous people, water is life and thus should be protected.

                <p>The river Atrato case in Colombia shows that a river has a legal personality and has bestowed upon it certain constitutional rights. In the case, ethnic community organizations (Cocomopoca, Cocomacia, Asocoba, FISCH) in the Choco
                  region, who are represented by the Centre for Social Justice Studies Tierra Digna sued the Presidency and Ministry of Environment in Colombia. The reason being to failure to protect the right to health, life, food security and a
                  healthy environment of ethnic communities in the context of illegal Gold mining in Colombia. The court establishes that the right to water in the Atrato basin is defined as a source of water and biodiversity in the world that has a
                  right to protection by its own right. The rivers rights need to be protected by communities and government.</p>

                <p>The Atrato River, its basin and tributaries are recognized as an entity subject to rights of protection, conservation, maintenance and restoration by the State and ethnic communities. The right to food security is infringed because
                  the illegal mining activities pollute and seriously threaten water resources and forests.</p>

                <p>Indigenous and afro descendent people have the oldest rights to territory. That is recognized in the Charter 169 of the International Labour Organization with the Right to Free Prior and Informed Consent. </p>
                <p>This convention has been ratified by the majority of states in the world, and is therefore the most important instrument in the struggle for their territorial, environmental and other rights. With this instrument indigenous and
                  afro descendent people have a say in important environmental questions regarding their historic ancestral lands. This means that indigenous and afro descendent people are at the forefront of the struggle against further
                  deterioration of environment.</p> Additionally, the corporate interest they fight, go more often than not also hand in hand with corruption, human rights abuse. Sadly, the amount of people getting killed in the process is
                unquestionably high, right because of their position in the forefront of this struggle.
                <p>Multinationals and their economic interests in mining and other megaprojects are imposing their desire for “development” on local and indigenous communities. Multinationals are generally, directly or indirectly, on the wrong side
                  of the environmental struggle, turning a blind eye to human rights abuses, corruption and violations of land and other ancestral rights. </p>

                  are many national and international rules that oblige states and businesses to human rights and environmental laws and also proper Due Diligence. There are initiatives to put all the Due Diligence standards in binding treaties,
                  which is a matter of time before that will be applied. </p>
